# OSML-IoT-WNS
Wireless network of temperature, humidity, and light sensors on Raspberry Pi Zeros via Node-RED and BlueMix.

This project is a collaboration between Theo Noordeloos and Joy Lopez Cervera with help from Dan Hendricks at the Open Source Maker Labs.
The purpose of this project is to convert PiZeros into wireless network nodes that sample themperature and humidity via a DHT11 sensor, and samples light via a LDR sensor; feed the information via wireless through a Node-RED flow; visualize the data via the IBM IoT BlueMix cloud.

The project requires:

Hardware
3 PiZeros with internet (or internet dongles if using PiZeros or Pi 3s without internet)
3 PiZero power adaptors
1 Monitor with HDMI output
Laptop or Desktop
USB Keyboard
USB Mouse
1 HDMI cable
USB 2.0 to micorUSB hub
3 HDMI to microHDMI adaptors
40 pin Header
3 Cases (optional)
3 small bread boards
3 DHT11 sensors
3 LDR sensore
3 1 uF capacitors
Assorted wire
Solder wire
Flux
Soldering station
Sponge of wire wool

Software
